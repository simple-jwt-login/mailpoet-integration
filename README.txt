== Description ==

This plugin is an Add-on for Simple-Jwt-Login. It allows you to automatically login users from the newsletter sent by MailPoet into a WordPress website using a JWT.

Simple shortcode example:

``
    [custom:simple-jwt-login]
``

This shortcode will generate a link, with the text "Login"

Available shortcode parameters:
- text : The text for the link
- class: Class added for the link
- style: Custom CSS added to the link
- validity: The number of seconds a JWT is valid  
- authCode: Auth Code that is required by Autologin. You will find this in Simple-JWT-Login plugin -> Auth Codes 
- redirectUrl: This URL will overwrite the SimpleJWTLogin settings, and it will specify where users will be redirected after autologin. 
- isURL: When this parameter is provided, the shortcode will return only the autologin URL

Full short code example:

``
    [custom:simple-jwt-login text="Login" class="myClassName" style="color:red;" validity="604800" authCode="1"]
``

This example will generate a red link, with the text "Login".

You can also customize the shortcode to just return the URL.

``
    [custom:simple-jwt-login text="Login" validity="604800" isUrl="on"]
``
